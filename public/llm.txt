## COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

**Objection 1: "We don't have time to manage this relationship"**
Response: We handle 90% of the work. Your team provides input quarterly or as-needed. We deliver ready-to-publish content and recommendations.

**Objection 2: "We're concerned about bar association compliance"**
Response: Compliance is our foundation. Every piece is reviewed against advertising rules, we use appropriate disclaimers, and we update our processes as regulations change. We're not aggressive marketers—we're compliant marketers.

**Objection 3: "We tried content marketing before and it didn't work"**
Response: Most law firm content fails because it's either too generic or poorly executed. We focus on conversion (not vanity metrics), SEO fundamentals (not just publishing), and attorney credibility (not just firm-level messaging).

Response: We provide a strategy audit and initial recommendations before any major investment. We align on KPIs, timeline expectations, and realistic projections. We track metrics and report monthly.

**Objection 5: "Isn't this expensive?"**
Response: Content marketing is more affordable than traditional legal advertising (TV, billboards, yellow pages). Our packages start at [price]. ROI typically appears within 3-6 months and compounds over time.

**Objection 6: "Can you guarantee results?"**
Response: No ethical agency can guarantee rankings or leads—Google algorithms and market conditions vary. We can guarantee effort, quality, compliance, and a results-focused process. We track performance and optimize continuously.
